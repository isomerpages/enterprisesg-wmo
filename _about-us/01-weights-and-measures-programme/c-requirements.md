### Requirements under the Weights and Measures Programme

#### 1. Approval of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use

Under the Weights and Measures Act, all weighing or measuring instruments for use for trade must have its pattern or type approved by the Weights and Measures Office before they can be used in Singapore. The pattern of a weighing and measuring instrument refers to the design of an instrument with all components affecting its measurement properties suitably specified.

Approved patterns of weighing and measuring instrument have undergone various tests and are in compliance with the relevant international standards. This ensures that the instruments can maintain their accuracy under different climatic and operating conditions, and that no substandard design of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use are used in Singapore.

The Weights and Measures Office has published a [Register of Weighing and Measuring Instruments Granted Pattern Approval](https://cpsa.enterprisesg.gov.sg/totalagility/forms/cpssite/PUBSearchGPA.form){:target="_blank"} to help consumers and traders identify weighing or measuring instruments that have been granted pattern approval in accordance with the Weights and Measures Act and Regulations.

#### 2. Verification of approved weighing and measuring instruments for trade use

Approved patterns of weighing or measuring instruments must be verified by an Authorised Verifier, secured from tampering, and stamped with the Accuracy Label
before being used for trade.

The annual verification of a non-automatic weighing instrument involves a process that ensures the instrument is functioning correctly and sealed, so that subsequent signs of tampering would be evident. This is to safeguard the interests of both consumers and traders.
