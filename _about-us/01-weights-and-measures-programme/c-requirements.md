## Approval Of Weighing and Measuring Instruments For Trade Use

Under the Weights and Measures Act, all weighing or measuring instruments for use for trade must have its pattern or type approved by the Weights and Measures Office before they can be used in Singapore. The pattern of a weighing and measuring instrument refers to the design of an instrument with all components affecting its measurement properties suitably specified.

Approved patterns of weighing and measuring instrument have undergone various tests and are in compliance with the relevant international standards. This ensures that the instruments can maintain their accuracy under different climatic and operating conditions, and that no substandard design of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use are used in Singapore.

The Weights and Measures Office has published a [Register of Weighing and Measuring Instruments Granted Pattern Approval](https://cpsa.enterprisesg.gov.sg/totalagility/forms/cpssite/PUBSearchGPA.form){:target="_blank"} to help consumers and businesses identify weighing or measuring instruments that have been granted pattern approval in accordance with the Weights and Measures Act and Regulations.

## Verification Of Approved Weighing and Measuring Instruments For Trade Use

Approved patterns of weighing or measuring instruments must be verified by an Authorised Verifier, secured from tampering, and stamped with the Accuracy Label
before being used for trade.

Under the Weights and Measures Act, qualified companies are allowed to carry out the verification and stamping of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use 
under the Authorised Verifier Scheme administered by the Weights and Measures Office. The Recognised Testing Laboratory (Flowmeter) Scheme is also implemented to 
supplement the verification capability of flowmeters used for trade in Singapore.
