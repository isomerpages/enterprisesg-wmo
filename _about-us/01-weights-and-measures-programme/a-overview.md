## Accurate and Uniform System for Businesses and Consumers
The Weights and Measures Programme is a system of verification in place to ensure accurate weights and measures. This system requires that all weighing and measuring instruments used are type approved, registered with the Weights and Measures Office, and thereafter verified by Authorised Verifiers. This ensures that buying and selling of goods based on weights or measures are fair.
