## Overview 
The Weights and Measures Programme is a system of verification in place to ensure accurate weights and measures. This system requires that all weighing and measuring instruments used are type approved, registered with the Weights and Measures Office, and thereafter verified by Authorised Verifiers. This ensures that buying and selling of goods based on weights or measures are fair.

## Scope of the Weights and Measures programme 

The Weights and Measures Programme covers weighing and measuring instruments for trade use. "For trade use" refers to transactions involving the transferring or rendering of money worth by reference to a certain quantity of goods exchanged, or where there is payment in respect of any toll or duty. Examples of such instruments include:

- Non-automatic  weighing  instruments  such  as  spring  scales,  electronic scales, weigh bridge, etc
- Flow meters
