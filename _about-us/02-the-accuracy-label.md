The ACCURACY Label is attached on weighing and measuring instruments that are verified fit for trade use. A verification seal is also attached to prevent tampering of the instruments.
 
The label can be found on prominent areas of the weighing and measuring instruments. It has a verifier code and the period (month and year) when the verification was conducted. This helps consumers and traders to identify that the instruments were accurate at the time of verification. However, the label does not guarantee that the instruments will remain accurate after verification.
