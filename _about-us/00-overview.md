## About the Weights and Measures Office
The Weights and Measures Office (WMO) is a department of Enterprise Singapore.
It is the national body for legal metrology in Singapore and oversees the administration of the [Weights and Measures Act][1]{:target="_blank"}  and the [Weights and Measures Regulations 2005][2]{:target="_blank"}. 

The Weights and Measures Office regulates weighing and measuring instruments for trade, such as mass, length and volumetric measurements of food, fuel and other essential commodities including pre-packaged goods.

Our Mission is to ensure a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore. Our Vision is to ensure fair trade measurements to protect the interest of consumers and businesses. 

### What we do?

To ensure a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore, we:

- Designate Authorised Verifiers to perform verification of weighing and measuring instruments
- Register approved weighing and measuring instruments
- Inspect weighing and measuring instruments used for trade purposes to check for inaccuracies and ensure that they have not been tampered with
- Inspect goods sold to ensure they meet the weight declared
- Investigate complaints relating to weights and measures matters from consumers and traders
