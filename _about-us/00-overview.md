## About the Weights and Measures Office
The Weights and Measures Office (WMO) implements the Weights and Measures Act to ensure a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore. Weighing and measuring instruments used for trade are required to be checked and verified for accuracy in accordance to international standards. The net quantity of pre-packaged goods is also monitored by the WMO to assure the accuracy of the declared net quantity stated in products or product labels. The WMO is overseen by Enterprise Singapore.  

### What we do?

To ensure a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore, we:

- Designate Authorised Verifiers to perform verification of weighing and measuring instruments
- Register weighing and measuring instruments suitable for trade use
- Inspect weighing and measuring instruments used for trade purposes to check for inaccuracies and ensure that they have not been tampered with
- Inspect goods sold to ensure they meet the weight declared
- Investigate complaints relating to weights and measures matters from consumers and traders
