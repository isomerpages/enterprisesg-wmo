## About the Weights and Measures Office
The Weights and Measures Office (WMO) safeguards the interests of consumers and businesses by ensuring a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore. 

Under the Weights and Measures Act, weighing and measuring instruments used for trade must be registered in accordance to international standards, verified for accuracy, and affixed with the ACCURACY Label. The WMO ensures that the declared net quantity stated in products or product labels of pre-packaged goods are accurate and conducts market surveillance, inspections and investigations to ensure fair trade measurement practices are upheld. 

The WMO is an office overseen by Enterprise Singapore.  


### What we do?

To ensure a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore, we:

- Designate Authorised Verifiers to perform verification of weighing and measuring instruments
- Register weighing and measuring instruments suitable for trade use
- Inspect weighing and measuring instruments used for trade purposes to check for inaccuracies and ensure that they have not been tampered with
- Inspect goods sold to ensure they meet the weight declared
- Investigate complaints relating to weights and measures matters from consumers and traders
