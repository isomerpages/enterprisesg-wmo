### Frequently Asked Questions 

**1. What is the ACCURACY Label?**
 
The ACCURACY Label is affixed onto a prominent part of the weighing or measuring instrument as proof to consumers and traders and to identify the instrument as having been verified or fit for trade use. However, it does not guarantee that the instrument will remain accurate thereafter. 

**2. What is the difference between the verification seal and the ACCURACY Label?** 

The verification seal comes in the form of a plastic or tamper-proof paper adhesive seal. The seal is generally affixed on the base/side or internal parts of the weighing or measuring instrument. A broken seal will indicate that the instrument could have been tampered with. 

The ACCURACY Label, on the other hand, is affixed on a prominent part of the weighing or measuring instrument to indicate that the instrument has been verified fit and accurate for trade use. 

**3. What does ’00 verified’ stands for on the ACCURACY Label?**
 
The 2-digit number ‘00’ on the ACCURACY Label means that the instrument has been verified by the Weights and Measures Office. If the verifier code reflects other 2-digit numbers (e.g. ‘01’, ‘02’), it means that the instrument has been verified by an Authorised Verifier designated by the Weights and Measures Office. 

**4. Does this mean that weighing and measuring instruments which bear such ACCURACY Labels are accurate?**
 
The ACCURACY Label only shows that the weighing or measuring instrument is verified as accurate at the time of verification. It is not a guarantee that the instrument will remain accurate after verification has been carried out. 

**5. The ACCURACY Label on my weighing instrument has come off. Do I need to replace the ACCURACY Label?**
 
Please immediately send your instrument to any designated Authorised Verifier should the ACCURACY Label come off from your weighing or measuring instrument. 

Other than through fair wear and tear, it is an offence if the ACCURACY Label is found to be forged, counterfeited, altered or defaced. g

**6. Is it necessary to have the ACCURACY Label affixed on my weighing and measuring instruments?**
 
All weighing or measuring instruments for trade use are required to be verified before use and affixed with the ACCURACY Label. It is an offence not to have the ACCURACY Label affixed on your weighing or measuring instruments. Any person found to be using a weighing or measuring instrument for trade use which is not affixed with an ACCURACY Label will be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000. 

**7. After selling the verified instruments with the ACCURACY Label on it, my customers after some time, have requested the instruments to be affixed with an up-to-date ACCURACY Label. In this case, what should I do?**
 
Every ACCURACY Label affixed to a weighing or measuring instrument is valid for a period of 12 months immediately following the month which it is affixed. Should the ACCURACY Label on the weighing or measuring instrument lapse, you are requested to submit the weighing or measuring instrument to a relevant Authorised Verifier. 

**8. I have a new weighing or measuring instrument that was verified fit for trade use and affixed with the ACCURACY Label. If I plan to sell it in a few months or a year later, do I need to have the weighing or measuring instrument re-verified and affixed with the latest ACCURACY Label?**
 
The ‘brand new’ verified instrument which has been affixed with the ACCURACY Label can still be used for trade. Do note that the ACCURACY Label is valid for 12 months immediately following the month which is affixed. Should the ACCURACY Label lapse, please submit the instrument to a relevant Authorised Verifier.
