- Look out for the ACCURACY Label on the instrument.
- Check that the display indicates ‘zero’ before the goods are weighed.
- Make sure you are charged for the net weight of the goods. Avoid weighing products with other items such as ice or heavy containers.
- Check the receipt to make sure items’ prices are calculated correctly.
- Alert the seller when the weight or price display is not clear or inaccurate. Get the seller to repeat the weighing or measuring if it is not done correctly.

**2. When buying pre-packaged products**

- Check goods with torn or tampered packaging to ensure net quantity is not less than that stated on the label.
- The label should state the net content of the product using the metric unit system for example, kilogram (kg) for weight measurement.
- Check the weight of the product on a weighing scale if you are doubtful of what is stated on the label.

**3. When refueling at the petrol station**

- Ensure the price and volume electronic display indicates ‘zero’ before dispensing fuel.
- Look out for any fuel leak before dispensing. Alert the station manager immediately if a leak is observed.
- Ensure the total price paid tally with the amount of fuel.
