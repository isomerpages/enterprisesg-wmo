Weighing or measuring instruments prescribed under the [First Schedule of the Weights and Measures Regulations](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/WMA1975-S844-2005?DocDate=20180329&ProvIds=Sc1-#Sc1-) which are used for trade in Singapore need to be verified for accuracy annually by an Authorised Verifier to ensure that consumers get what they pay for. 

Verified instruments will be affixed with an ACCURACY Label. The ACCURACY Label is valid for 12 months from the month the instrument it is affixed to, was verified. Subsequent re-verification of the weighing or measuring instrument by an Authorised Verifier is required to renew the ACCURACY Label.

**QR code label**

Effective 30 November 2021, weighing and measuring instruments used for trade will also be affixed with a QR code label bearing a unique 7-digit identification number.

The first 2 digits represent the year the instrument was registered in CPSA+. For example, instrument was registered by the AV in 2021, the unique identification number for the instrument would thus start with ‘21’ followed by its serialised number e.g., 21XXXXX.

Consumers may either scan the QR code or search for the 7-digit unique identification number in the public registry [here](https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/PublicRegistryInstrumentList){:target="_blank"}, to access more information about the instrument such as validity of its ACCURACY Label, date of last verification, as well as the business owner/ user of the instrument.

Scanning the QR code would also allow consumers to report on the instrument to the WMO. For example, if the instrument is found to have an expired ACCURACY Label, it is not reading zero even without any load placed on it, etc.
