## Change in authority’s name from the Consumer Protection, Weights and Measures Division, to the Weights and Measures Office

This circular is to inform Authorised Verifiers (AVs) and Recognised Testing Laboratories (RTLs) on the change in our office name.
It is for noting and no further action is required.

With effect from 01 Jun 2021, please be informed that the current “Consumer Protection, Weights and Measures Division” of Enterprise Singapore, will be renamed to the “Consumer Product Safety, Weights and Measures Office”. 
The Weights and Measures Office (WMO), an office overseen by Enterprise Singapore, will oversee weighing and measuring instruments and packaged goods regulated under the Weights and Measures Act.

The change is to better reflect the Weights and Measures Office’s objective to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses by ensuring a uniform and accurate system of weights and measures in Singapore.

There is **no change** to the design of the existing ACCURACY Label used by AVs. The current website <https://cpsa.enterprisesg.gov.sg> also **remains valid and accessible** to users. AVs may continue to access the site for submission of stamping reports purposes.

For more information on the Weights and Measures Office, please visit our new website at <https://www.weightsandmeasures.gov.sg>. Moving forward, any updates including new circulars on regulatory requirements will be made available there (including a copy of this circular). AVs and RTLs are encouraged to visit and bookmark our website for the latest information.

AVs may direct traders to our new website and remind them on our requirement to have their instrument verified and affixed with the ACCURACY Label by an AV before it can be used for trade purposes.

For further enquiries, you may contact the WMO at 6898 1800 or email to <weightsandmeasures@enterprisesg.gov.sg>.
