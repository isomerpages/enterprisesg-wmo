### Update to the AV Scheme information booklet on conflict of interest

Dear Authorised Verifiers (AVs),

This circular is to inform you that we have updated sections of the AV Scheme information booklet to clarify on requirements pertaining to conflict of interest (COI). 
AVs are to refer to the following sections of the [AV Scheme booklet][1]{:target="_blank"} for further details and undertake the necessary actions:

[1]:/files/businesses/av_scheme_info_booklet.pdf

- Section 5.2 (h) – new applicants and existing AVs will be assessed for potential COI for purposes of AV designation. See the explanatory notes 
under this section for further details on what constitutes COI and the declaration process;
- Appendix D – Terms and Conditions of appointment / re-appointment as AV has been updated to include provisions on COI. See paragraphs 7 to 10;
- Appendix G – Conflict of Interest Declaration Form.

This update provides further clarity on how the WMO manages COI for the purpose of AV designation. The update is also part of the WMO’s ongoing effort to improve on our AV Scheme framework to ensure a fair and transparent system of 
weights and measures in Singapore. 

This update is effective from 04 June 2021. AVs due for AV re-designation from 04 June 2021 onwards will have to submit the completed Conflict of Interest 
Declaration Form found in Appendix G of the AV Scheme booklet prior to their onsite audit. **Please refer to the Annex of this Circular for more information regarding 
this update**.

The updated Terms and Conditions of appointment and re-appointment as AV found in Appendix D of the AV Scheme booklet will apply to AVs designated from 04
June 2021 onwards.

For further enquiries, you may write to <weightsandmeasures@enterprisesg.gov.sg>.
