### For users of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use


**Pattern registration of weighing and measuring instruments**

Weighing or measuring instruments used for trade in Singapore need to have their pattern or type registered with the Weights and Measures Office, and verified by an Authorised Verifier to ensure the instrument’s accuracy and fit for trade use. Examples of such instruments may be found in the Singapore Weights and Measures information booklet. 

Please refer to **Appendix D** of the Weights and Measures Information Booklet below for the registration process of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use.


**Verification of weighing and measuring instruments**

Under the Weights and Measures Act, it is an offence to use unregistered i.e., not pattern registered, and/or unverified instruments for trade in Singapore. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure the instrument is verified, secured from tampering, and affixed with the Accuracy Label by an Authorised Verifier (AV) before using it for trade. 

Please refer to **Appendix E** of the Weights and Measures Information Booklet below for the process to get your instrument verified. 

<i><u>QR code label and registration of weighing and measuring instruments in CPSA+</u></i>

The CPSA+ is an application website where AVs can submit verification records, as well as where the public registry of pattern registered instruments, list of weighting and measuring instrument used for trade, list of designated AVs, etc. are hosted. 

Instrument owners can also login to CPSA+ to view information related to the weighing and measuring instruments they use for trade, e.g. the verification status of the instrument, it’s operating location, etc. The instrument would first need to be registered in CPSA+ before this information will be viewable.  

Effective 30 November 2021, weighing and measuring instruments used for trade will be affixed with a QR code label bearing a unique 7-digit identification number for purpose of instrument registration in the CPSA+ system. The QR code label is to be affixed on the instrument by an AV prior to conducting the initial verification. The QR code will be affixed next to the Accuracy Label on the instrument.

The first 2 digits of the identification number represent the year the instrument was registered in CPSA+. For example, if the instrument was registered by the AV in 2021, the unique identification number for the instrument would thus start with ‘21’ followed by its serialised number e.g., 21XXXXX.

Unlike the Accuracy Label which is valid for 12 months, and has to be replaced prior to its expiry, the QR code label is meant to be permanent, and should only be changed by an AV if it is found damaged or missing from the registered instrument.

By logging in to CPSA+ and updating your contact information, instrument owners can also receive notifications from CPSA+ about your instruments.

**Metric system of units**

Traders should also ensure that you use the metric system of units when transacting or advertising goods. For example, Kilogram for goods measured by weight, and Litre for goods measured by volume.
