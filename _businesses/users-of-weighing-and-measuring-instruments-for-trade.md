<h3>For users of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use</h3>
<p><strong>Ensure that the weighing/measuring instrument has been pattern registered with the Weights and Measures Office</strong>
</p>
<p>Businesses using weighing or measuring instruments for trade (i.e., where
transactions are based on the quantity measured by the instrument) must
use instruments pattern registered with the Weights and Measures Office
(WMO). The instrument will then need to be verified by an Authorized Verifier
(AV) and affixed with the ACCURACY Label before it can be used for trade
purpose.</p>
<p>You can find a list of WMO pattern registered weighing and measuring instruments
in the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegistryOfRegisteredSuppliersAndPatternApproval" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Register of Weighing and Measuring Instruments Granted Pattern Approval</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Submit the instrument to an Authorized Verifier (AV) to verify that it is fit for trade use</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the Weights and Measures Act, it is an offence to use unregistered
i.e., not pattern registered, and/or unverified instruments for trade in
Singapore.</p>
<p>Businesses can contact one of the Authorized Verifiers which are appointed
by the WMO to carry out verification of these instruments. Their contact
details can be found on our <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterOfAuthorisedVerifier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Register of Authorized Verifiers</a>.</p>
<p>Instrument verification records are immediately approved when submitted
by the AV through the WMO's application website (<a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/HomePage/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSA+</a>). Members of public
and businesses will be able to view the details of the instruments, including
verification statuses, using the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/PublicRegistryInstrumentList" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Register of Instruments</a>.</p>
<p>Please refer to <strong>Appendix E</strong> of the Weights and Measures
Information Booklet below for the process to get your instrument verified.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><u>QR code label and registration of weighing and measuring instruments in CPSA+</u></em>
</p>
<p>The CPSA+ is an application website where AVs can submit verification
records, as well as where the public registry of pattern registered instruments,
list of weighting and measuring instrument used for trade, list of designated
AVs, etc. are hosted.</p>
<p>Instrument owners can also login to CPSA+ to view information related
to the weighing and measuring instruments they use for trade, e.g. the
verification status of the instrument, it’s operating location, etc. The
instrument would first need to be registered in CPSA+ before this information
will be viewable.</p>
<p>Effective 30 November 2021, weighing and measuring instruments used for
trade will be affixed with a QR code label bearing a unique 7-digit identification
number for purpose of instrument registration in the CPSA+ system. The
QR code label is to be affixed on the instrument by an AV prior to conducting
the initial verification. The QR code will be affixed next to the ACCURACY
Label or, in a position on the instrument easily seen by consumers.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:295px;height:93px;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="wmo-qr-code-label" src="/images/al-and-qr-label.png">
</div>
<p>The first 2 digits of the identification number represent the year the
instrument was registered in CPSA+. For example, if the instrument was
registered by the AV in 2021, the unique identification number for the
instrument would thus start with ‘21’ followed by its serialised number
e.g., 21XXXXX.</p>
<p>Unlike the ACCURACY Label which is valid for 12 months, and has to be
replaced prior to its expiry, the QR code label is meant to be permanent,
and should only be changed by an AV if it is found damaged or missing from
the registered instrument.</p>
<p><em><u>Notifications from CPSA+</u></em>
</p>
<p>For registered businesses with UEN, the contact information provided to
the AVs for purpose of instrument registration will receive the following
notifications from CPSA+:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>List of instruments successfully registered by the AV in CPSA+</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List of instruments verified by the AV after its record has been successfully
submitted in CPSA+</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reminder that there are instruments due for re-verification in 2 months’
time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reminder that there are instruments with lapsed ACCURACY Labels and
to contact an AV for re-verification before they are used for trade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacement of Instrument ID for any of your registered instruments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Registered businesses with UEN may also login CPSA+ to update your contact
information or location of your instrument if there are any changes.</p>
<p>For instrument owners with no UEN, notifications on the instruments will
be sent via SMS based on the contact information provided to the AVs for
instrument registration.</p>
<p>You may find out more about the QR code label and registration of instruments
in CPSA+ in <a href="/files/businesses/wmo_info_booklet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chapter 4.2 of the Weights and Measures Information Booklet</a>{:target="_blank"}.</p>
<p>For more information on how to login to CPSA+ and access information about
your registered instruments, click <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>{:target="_blank"} and refer
to the CPSA+ guidebook for weighing and measuring instrument owners.</p>
<p><strong>Metric system of units</strong>
</p>
<p>Traders should also ensure that you use the metric system of units when
transacting or advertising goods. For example, Kilogram for goods measured
by weight, and Litre for goods measured by volume.</p>
