## For Manufacturers and/or Packers, Importers and/or Distributors, and Retailers of Pre-packaged Goods 

It is an offence to supply or sell pre-packaged goods (PPGs) with net content less than the quantity stated on the package or label. Suppliers and/or retailers should have their own system or measures in place to ensure net content of the PPGs is as per stated on the package or label.

Suppliers and/or retailers should also ensure the net content of the pre-packaged good stated on the label is in the metric system of measurement. For example, Kilogram (kg) for measurement by weight.

The Average Quantity System (AQS) is an internationally recognised sampling method used by businesses to check that the pre-packaged goods they sell are accurately filled.

A sampled batch would fulfil the AQS if,

1. The average content of the packages in a sampled batch is not less than the quantity stated on the packaging;
2. The number of non-standard pre-packages sampled from an sample batch does not exceed the tolerable deficiency; and
3. No pre-packaged goods shall have its net contents exceeding twice the tolerable deficiency from its stated quantity.
