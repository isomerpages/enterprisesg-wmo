## For Authorised Verifiers and Recognised Testing Laboratories (Flowmeter) 

Under the Weights and Measures Act, qualified companies are allowed to carry out the verification and stamping of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use under the Authorised Verifier Scheme administered by Enterprise Singapore. The Recognised Testing Laboratory (Flowmeter) Scheme is also implemented to supplement the verification capability of flowmeters used for trade in Singapore. For more information on these schemes, refer to the links below.
