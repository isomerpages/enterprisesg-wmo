### For manufacturers and/or packers, importers and/or distributors, and retailers of pre-packaged goods

Pre-packaged goods (PPGs) are goods enclosed in a packaging that are made up in advance for sale where the quantity of the product has been predetermined.

Pre-packaged goods may be (i) pre-packages of the same kind and of the same stated quantity; or (ii) catchweight goods that are sold in varying quantities due to the nature of the goods.  

It is an offence to supply PPGs with quantities less than the quantity stated on the package or label. 

WMO inspectors conduct regular inspections on the net content of pre-packaged goods and businesses should cooperate and facilitate these surveillance activities when required.

The net content of a pre-packaged good refers to the content of the product excluding any packaging materials such as, plastic wrappers and labels, ice glaze, absorbent pad and excess water etc.

Suppliers and/or retailers are encouraged to establish a system of controls or measures to ensure the accuracy of the net content. This includes, but is not limited to, setting up of effective sampling, checking, and testing plans, or using only appropriate equipment for checks

**Metric system of units**

Suppliers and/or retailers should also ensure the net content of the PPG stated on the label is in the metric system of units. Below are examples of metric units commonly used in trade measurements. For other metric units of measurement, refer to the First Schedule of the [Weights and Measures Act][1]{:target="_blank"}.
