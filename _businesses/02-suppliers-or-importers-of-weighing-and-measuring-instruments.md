## For suppliers or importers of weighing and measuring instruments 

Weighing or measuring instruments used for trade in Singapore need to have its pattern or type approved. Examples of such instruments may be found in the Singapore Weights and Measures Programme information booklet.
 
The pattern of a weighing and measuring instrument refers to the design of an instrument with all components affecting its measurement properties suitably specified. Such instruments must show proof that they have undergone various tests and are in compliance with the relevant international standards. This is to ensure that the instruments can maintain their accuracy under different climatic and operating conditions. 

By registering the pattern of the weighing and measuring instrument, it ensures that no substandard design of weighing and measuring instruments for trade use are used in Singapore.

Weighing or measuring instruments which are manufactured for use for trade purposes, must have in their instruction or operation manuals/leaflets, a statement advising users to  seek  approval  from  their  national  weights  and  measures  authority  before  these instruments can be used for trade purposes.
