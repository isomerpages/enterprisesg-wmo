## Overview

Businesses have the responsibility to ensure that all weighing and measuring instruments used are type approved, registered with the Weights and Measures Office, and thereafter verified by Authorised Verifiers. In addition, the net contents of pre-packaged goods must not be less than the quantity stated on the  package  or  label.

Businesses should also ensure that their weighing or measuring instruments are:

- Accurate at all times;
- Installed and used in suitable environmental conditions e.g. weighing scales should be used on level ground;
- Zeroed before goods are weighed or measured; 
- Cleaned and free from foreign particles on the weighing or measuring areas, e.g. weighing pan, dispenser nozzles;
- Sent for annual verification to prevent short weights or measures; 
- Affixed with the Weights andMeasures verification seal at all times; 
- Affixed with a valid ACCURACY Label that is visible to consumers at all times; and
- Showing a visual reading to consumers e.g. with the use of electronic dual-faced indicator type of instruments.
