<h3>For suppliers or importers of weighing and measuring instruments</h3>
<p>Suppliers of weighing and measuring instruments to be used for trade in
Singapore, must show proof that your instruments have undergone various
tests and are in compliance with the relevant international standards,
to attest that the instruments can maintain their accuracy under different
types of operating conditions.</p>
<p>Weighing or measuring instruments used for trade in Singapore must have
their pattern or type registered with the Weights and Measures Office before
they can be used in Singapore. Examples of such instruments may be found
in the Singapore Weights and Measures information booklet. The pattern
of a weighing and measuring instrument refers to the design of an instrument
with all components affecting its measurement properties suitably specified.</p>
<p>By registering the pattern of the weighing and measuring instrument, it
ensures that no substandard design of weighing and measuring instruments
for trade use are used in Singapore.</p>
<p>In addition, weighing or measuring instruments which are manufactured
for use for trade purposes, must have in their instruction or operation
manuals/leaflets, a statement advising users to seek approval from their
national weights and measures authority before these instruments can be
used for trade purposes.</p>
